# React_Wordle-Clone
This repo contains code for wordle clone. Instead of 1 chance a day, you can play it as many times as you want. The words are stored in the backend and you can add or remove words as per your wish.
This is coded to replicate the game logic of the actual wordle without going into registration or login.
